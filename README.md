# Epigenomics
## Introduction
In examining the diversity of life, we're often directed to the sequence of an organism's DNA as the source of variation. Differences in these genomes are directly correlated with changes in genetic products, regulatory affects, and molecular interactions--all of which contribute to the great phenotypic variety observed in our world.

However, in this paper, we wish to look beyond the genome. Instead, we introduce the topic of epigenomics, the analysis of gene expression that is not attributable to mutations to the DNA sequence of a genome. Rather, epigenetic expression alteration is caused by biochemical interactions with various proteins and other compounds.

We will describe the biology two most well-known epigenomic modifications: [DNA Methylation](#Biology-DNA-Methylation) and [Histone Modifications](#Biology:-Histone-Modifications). We will also describe the analytical techniques used to quantify each epigenomic modification and its affect on gene expression.
